## Installation

Put **clist** inside `garrysmod/addons` folder. Now restart your server and enjoy !

## Usage

Type de command **`!clist`** in the chat to open the menu (*Only SuperAdmin are allowed to*). 

In the menu you have 4 main elements:

1. **The Elements List:** This is the list of the models registerd in the PropList. It's empty by default.
2. **The 'Add' Button:** Click this button to open a popup window where you can enter a model's name to add to the PropList.
3. **The 'Remove' Button:** Click on this button to remove all selected Elements from the PropList. (*Click on the elements in the Elements List to select it*)
4. **The Mode Toggle Button:** Click on this button to toggle the Mode. There are 3 Modes (*See below*).

## Modes

- The Mode **"Disabled"**, in this mode the addon is disabled and do not block anything.
- The Mode **"Blacklist"**, in this mode all the Elements in the PropList are blocked when a player tries to spawn it.
- The Mode **"Whitelist"**, in this mode all the Props not in the PropList are blocked. (*This is the most useful*)

**Note: Admin players are allowed to bypass all of these**

## Blocking

When the addons detects that a prop shouldn't be spawned, it prevents it from being spawned on the server and warn the player about it.
